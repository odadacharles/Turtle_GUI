Exercises utilizing the turtle package in python
main.py - move the turtle 100 steps while creating a dashed line
shapes - draw several shapes with an ever-increasing number of corners
spirograph - use the turtle to draw a spirograph
random_walk - Illustrate the random walk concept using turtle

P.S. The random_color function can be shared by importing. However, this method resulted in pycharm
running the wrong 'current file'. It may be a bug, or it may be something else.
